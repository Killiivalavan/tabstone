# 🪦 TABSTONE

> **Ghost your tabs — guilt-free.**

A Chrome Extension that helps you declutter browser tabs without forgetting them forever. Instead of keeping dozens of tabs open indefinitely, you can "bury" your current tabs into a visually themed "graveyard" where they can be organized into named groups and later "resurrected" (reopened) individually or as groups.

## ✨ Core Functionalities

- **🪦 Bury All Tabs**: Close all current tabs while saving them to a named group
- **📁 Group Management**: Organize buried tabs into custom-named groups
- **🔄 Resurrect Tabs**: Reopen individual tabs or entire groups
- **🗑️ Cleanup**: Delete individual tabs or entire groups
- **💾 Local Storage**: All data stored locally for privacy
- **🎨 Thematic Design**: Graveyard aesthetic with dark theme
